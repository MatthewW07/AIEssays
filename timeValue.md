# Measuring the Value of Time

People often say, “That’s not worth my time,” but what does that really mean? For something to be considered “not worth it,” the rest of a person’s time must be valued higher than that activity. This suggests that every moment of a person’s time could be assigned a value based on a ratio: the benefit they receive from an activity compared to the time spent doing it.
This concept of the “value of time” goes beyond just deciding whether an event is worthwhile—it could be analyzed mathematically. If we plotted a person’s value of time on a graph at different moments, we could see clear patterns in how they use their time effectively or waste it.

For example, consider a student studying for a test. At first, if they are focused and relearning the material well, their value of time is high. Eventually, they need a break, so they spend five minutes on Instagram. This break has value—it lets their brain rest and prepares them for more studying. However, if they continue scrolling through reels for an extended period, their value of time decreases. The break is no longer serving a productive purpose; they are simply wasting time.

This concept can also be applied to decision-making and planning. If someone is deciding whether to attend an event, they could determine if there’s a way to fit it into their schedule while still maintaining a beneficial average value of time throughout the day. Instead of making vague judgments about whether something is “worth it,” they could assess how it fits into their overall time usage.

Additionally, when someone says an event “isn’t worth their time,” it implies that whatever they plan to do instead must have a higher value of time than the event itself. This means decisions about time aren’t just about rejecting low-value activities but about prioritizing the highest-value options available.

By thinking of time in this way, we could have a more objective way of determining whether something is truly “worth it.” Instead of relying on feelings or assumptions, we could use measurable data to assess how people spend their time and whether their choices align with their goals.
